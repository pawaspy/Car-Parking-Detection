## Car Parking Space Detection Website

### Introduction

This README.md file provides instructions for setting up and running the car parking space detection website locally using Streamlit and TensorFlow. The website takes an image of a parking space as input and predicts whether it's occupied (full) or free.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can verify this by running `python --version` in your terminal.
- **Required Packages:** Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

``pip install streamlit numpy pandas pillow matplotlib tensorflow tensorflow-keras scikit-learn localtunnel``
